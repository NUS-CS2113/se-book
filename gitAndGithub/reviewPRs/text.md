The _PR review_ stage is a dialog between the PR author and members of the repo that received the PR, in order to refine and eventually merge the PR.

Given below are some steps you can follow when reviewing a PR.

**1. Locate the PR:**
1. Go to the GitHub page of the repo.
1. Click on the <span class="tab">{{ icon_pr }} Pull requests</span> tab.
1. Click on the PR you want to review.

**2. Read the PR description.** It might contain information relevant to reviewing the PR.

**3. Click on the** <span class="tab">:octicon-diff: Files changed</span> tab to see the _diff_ view.

{{ icon_tip }} You can use the following setting to try the two different views available and pick the one you like.<br>

**4. Add review comments:**
1. Hover over the line you want to comment on and click on the <span style="color:#0066ff">:fas-plus-square:</span> icon that appears on the left margin. That should create a text box for you to enter your comment.
   * {{ icon_tip }} To give a comment related to multiple lines, click-and-drag the <span style="color:#0066ff">:fas-plus-square:</span> icon. The result will look like this:<br>

1. Enter your comment.<br>
   * {{ icon_resource }} [This page @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/guidelines/PRs-reviewing.html) has some best practices PR reviewers can follow.
   * {{ icon_tip }} To suggest an in-line code change, click on this icon:<br>
     <pic eager src="images/giveInlineSuggestion.png"/><br>
     After that, you can proceed to edit the `suggestion` code block generated by GitHub (as seen in the screenshot above).<br>
     The comment will look like this to the viewers:<br>
     <pic eager src="images/giveInlineSuggestionPreview.png"/><br>
1. After typing in the comment, click on the {{ button_green("Start a review") }} button (not the {{ button_light("Add single comment") }} button. This way, your comment is saved but not visible to others yet. It will be visible to others only when you have finished the entire review.<br>

   <p/>
1. Repeat the above steps to add more comments.

**5. Submit the review:**<br>
   <pic eager src="images/submitReview.png" width="500" />
   <p/>

1. When there are no more comments to add, click on the {{ button_green("Review changes :octicon-triangle-down:") }} button (on the top right of the diff page).
1. Type in an overall comment about the PR, if any. e.g.,
   ```{.no-line-numbers}
   Overall, I found your code easy to read for the most part except a few places
   where the nesting was too deep. I noted a few minor coding standard violations
   too. Some of the classes are getting quite long. Consider splitting into
   smaller classes if that makes sense.
   ```
   {{ icon_tip }} `LGTM` is often used in such overall comments, to indicate `Looks good to me` (or `Looks good to merge`).<br>
   `nit` (as in _nit-picking_) is another such term, used to indicate minor flaws e.g., `LGTM. Just a few nits to fix.`.
1. Choose `Approve`, `Comment`, or `Request changes` option as appropriate and click on the {{ button_green("Submit review") }} button.
