##### Tracking and ignoring

**In a repo, you can specify which files to track and which files to ==ignore==.** For example, we can configure Git to ignore temporary files created during the build/test process, as it does not make sense to track their version history.

##### Staging and committing

<tabs>
  <tab header="{{ icon_text }}">

**==_Committing_== saves a snapshot of the current state of the tracked files in the revision control history.** Such a snapshot is also called a _commit_ (i.e. the noun).

<include src="../../common/definitions.md#def-commit" trim />
</box>

**When ready to commit, you first add the specific changes you want to commit to a ==staging area==.** This intermediate step allows you to commit only some changes while saving other changes for a later commit.
