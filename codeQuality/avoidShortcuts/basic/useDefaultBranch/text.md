<div id="body">

**Always include a default branch in `case` statements.** This ensures that all possible outcomes have been considered at the branching point.

**Furthermore, use the `default` branch for the intended default action and not just to execute the last option.** If there is no default action, you can use the `default` branch to detect errors (i.e. if execution reached the `default` branch, raise a suitable error). This also applies to the final `else` of an `if-else` construct. That is, the final `else` should mean 'everything else', and not the final option. Do not use `else` when an `if` condition can be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.
