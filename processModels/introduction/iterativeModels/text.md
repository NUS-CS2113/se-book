**The iterative model (sometimes called _iterative_ and _incremental_) advocates having several _iterations_ of SDLC.** Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirements gathering to testing & deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.

**In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.** Feedback on the new version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization, etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.

**The iterative model can take a _breadth-first_ or a _depth-first_ approach to iteration planning.**
* **breadth-first**: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel %%e.g., add a new feature fully, or enhance an existing feature%%.
* **depth-first**: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components %%e.g., update the backend to support a new feature that will be added in a future iteration%%.

**Most projects use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations** %%i.e., an iteration can contain some breadth-first work as well as some depth-first work%%.
