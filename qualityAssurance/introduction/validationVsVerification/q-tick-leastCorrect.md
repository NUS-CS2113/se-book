(a)~~(b)~~(c)(d)(e)(f)

Explanation:

Whether something belongs under validation or verification is not that important. What is more important is that we do both.

Developer testing is more about finding bugs in the code, rather than bugs in the requirements.

In QA, system testing is more about verification (does the system follow the specification?) and acceptance testing is more about validation (does the system solve the userâ€™s problem?).

A system crash is more likely to be a bug in the code, not in the requirements.
