Testing cannot prove the absence of errors. It can only prove the presence of errors. However, formal methods can prove the absence of errors.

- ( ) True
- ( ) False

<panel type="seamless" header="{{ icon_A }} Answer" minimized>

True

Explanation: While using formal methods is more expensive than testing, it can indeed prove the correctness of a piece of software conclusively, in certain contexts. Getting such proof via testing requires exhaustive testing, which is not practical to do in most cases.
