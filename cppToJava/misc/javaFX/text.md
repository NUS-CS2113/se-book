<span id="title">JavaFX</span>

<div id="body">

JavaFX is a technology for building Java-based GUIs. Previously it was a part of Java itself, but has become a third-party dependency since then. It is now being maintained by [OpenJDK](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX).

Refer to the [_JavaFX tutorial_ @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFx.html) to learn how to get started with JavaFX.
