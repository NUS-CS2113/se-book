<div id="body">

**An _Application Programming Interface (API)_ specifies the interface through which other programs can interact with a software component.** It is a contract between the component and its clients.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} A class has an API (e.g., [API of the Java `String` class]({{ java_api }}/java/lang/String.html), [API of the Python `str` class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)) which is a collection of public methods that you can invoke to make use of the class.

{{ icon_example }} The [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) is a collection of web request formats that the GitHub server accepts and their corresponding responses. You can write a program that interacts with GitHub through that API.

</box>

When developing large systems, if you define the API of each component early, the development team can develop the components in parallel %%because the future behavior of the other components are now more predictable%%.
